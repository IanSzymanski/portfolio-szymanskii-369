Final freeCodeCamp certification project and personal portfolio.

Been wanting to make a header look like this for a while, so I thought that this would be the perfect time to try it. I only put my landing page in my works because it is the only project that I want to show off.

I am sooooo proud of my buttons and dividers. The after and before pseudo elements are like 2 extra versions of an element that you can use however you want and I am very proud of the way I used them here.
